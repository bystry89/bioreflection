I am sure that people know what they want since they're young, like if you're gay/trans or something. you don't have to be 18+ to know if you like girls or boys. you already know way before that. same with trans. but irreversible surgery is kind of a different topic. I don't think vasectomy/tubes tied is allowed as soon as someone turns 18. but i think this type of surgery should be allowed because that is a suitable age to decide to be 100% sure and not regret",98

My view is that as a minor you do not have the necessary life experience and understanding to be able to make such an important decision with such certainty.  It is imperative that minors should have to wait until they are fully grown adults with more knowledge and understanding of themselves, that sometimes you can experience feelings which although strong at the time prove to be temporary.  This is why minors should never be given the chance to make a decision which they may regret deeply as they reach maturity.",100
